#Bootstrap - Copy 2 pages of an application using Bootstrap

Find a website application such as Instragram, Facebook, Twitter, Stack Overflow, etc... and copy two pages using Twitter Bootstrap.  For example, copy the twitter registration page, and the twitter user homepage.  You don't need to copy colors or detailed styling, mainly you need to copy the layout and experiment with using the Bootstrap grid to position elements on the page.
